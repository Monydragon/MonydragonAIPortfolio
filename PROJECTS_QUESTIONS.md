## Games

### Timeless: The Last Artifacts

**Current Description:** Timeless: The Last Artifacts is a steampunk, story-driven roguelite adventure where you must maintain your sanity and stability within a collapsing timeline. The last hourglass of existence is faltering — and with it, the threads of all creation. You are a Timewalker, tasked with venturing into shifting chambers where relics of lost ages still hum with power.

Each chamber is a living paradox — filled with brass machinery, floating sands, and shimmering echoes of what once was. Artifacts you uncover grant immense power, but every gift exacts a price. Can you balance gain and decay long enough to restore the rhythm of time?

⚙️ Gameplay Breakdown

🕰️ Endless Chambers: Every run generates new environments, interactions, and artifacts. No two descents into the flux are ever the same.

⚖️ Sanity vs. Time: Your sanity slowly drains as temporal flux surges. Manage both to survive.

💎 Dynamic Artifacts: Relics offer dual-edged abilities — one beneficial, one harmful — making every discovery a strategic choice.

🧩 Puzzles and Interactions: Each chamber hides unique mechanics, secrets, and echo events that respond to your decisions.

🎮 Solo or Cooperative Mode: Stabilize the timeline alone or with up to 4 other Timewalkers, synchronizing your sanity and fate.

🌌 Procedural Storytelling: Dialogue and environmental details adapt to your decisions, revealing new fragments of the lore every run.

🧭 Story

The world’s last chronometer falters. In the heart of a dying era, the Hourwarden’s relics—artifacts forged to anchor time itself—are lost across collapsing dimensions.

You, a lone Timewalker (or a small crew of them), awaken within the Flux, a realm where seconds distort, and every motion echoes forever.

The hourglass pulses with unstable energy; sands flow both up and down. To restore balance, you must traverse its chambers, collect the remaining relics, and confront the paradoxes that consume the remnants of time.

But beware: every artifact you wield accelerates the collapse, twisting cause and effect against you.

Can you preserve your sanity long enough to restore what remains — or will you become just another echo in the endless flux?
